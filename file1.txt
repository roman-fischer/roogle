Exchanging patches¶
Creating a patch¶

You can use git format-patch command to generate patches with your commits to be e-mailed. These e-mails can be used either for reviewing or for applying the patches directly from them.

The syntax you need to use is: git format-patch <base-branch>..<your-development-branch> which will give you patches with all the commits which need to be applied to <base-branch> to get it to the state of <your-development-branch>.

In your situation, the command would look like this (giving you patches from origin to the HEAD of the development branch):

$  git format-patch origin..<your-development-branch>

You can also generate Git specific patches (which track properly renames) using "-M -B" for format-patch:

$  git format-patch -M -B origin..<your-development-branch>

Applying a patch¶

To apply a patch received via e-mail (generated by git format-patch) you can use:

$ git am <patch-file>
